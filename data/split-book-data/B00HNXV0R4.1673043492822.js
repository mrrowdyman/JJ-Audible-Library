window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</i> was the surprise best seller of 2011 - an unprecedented mix of YA fantasy and vintage photography that enthralled audiences and critics alike. <i>Publishers Weekly</i> called it \"an enjoyable, eccentric read, distinguished by well-developed characters, a believable Welsh setting, and some very creepy monsters.\" </p> <p>This second novel begins in 1940, immediately after the first book ended. Having escaped Miss Peregrine's island by the skin of their teeth, Jacob and his new friends must journey to London, the peculiar capital of the world. Along the way, they encounter new allies, a menagerie of peculiar animals, and other surprises. </p> <p>Complete with dozens of newly discovered (and thoroughly creepy) vintage photographs, this new adventure will delight fantasy fans of all ages.</p>";
