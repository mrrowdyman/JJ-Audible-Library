window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number-one <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller</p> <p><b>Grand Admiral Thrawn and Darth Vader team up against a threat to the Empire in this thrilling novel from best-selling author Timothy Zahn. </b></p> <p>“I have sensed a disturbance in the Force.” Ominous words under any circumstances, but all the more so when uttered by Emperor Palpatine. On Batuu, at the edges of the Unknown Regions, a threat to the Empire is taking root - its existence little more than a glimmer, its consequences as yet unknowable. But it is troubling enough to the Imperial leader to warrant investigation by his most powerful agents: ruthless enforcer Lord Darth Vader and brilliant strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Fierce rivals for the emperor’s favor, and outspoken adversaries on Imperial affairs - including the Death Star project - the formidable pair seem unlikely partners for such a crucial mission. But the Emperor knows it’s not the first time Vader and Thrawn have joined forces. And there’s more behind his royal command than either man suspects.</p> <p>In what seems like a lifetime ago, General Anakin Skywalker of the Galactic Republic, and Commander Mitth’raw’nuruodo, officer of the Chiss Ascendancy, crossed paths for the first time. One on a desperate personal quest, the other with motives unknown...and undisclosed. But facing a gauntlet of dangers on a far-flung world, they forged an uneasy alliance - neither remotely aware of what their futures held in store.</p> <p>Now, thrust together once more, they find themselves bound again for the planet where they once fought side by side. There they will be doubly challenged - by a test of their allegiance to the Empire...and an enemy that threatens even their combined might.</p> <p>Praise for <i>Thrawn: Alliances</i>:</p> <p>“It’s a science fiction beach read in the best way, brisk and amusing, with some cool additions to the Star Wars galaxy.” (Den of Geek)</p> <p>“Like all of Zahn’s novels set in a galaxy far, far away, it’s an essential read for anyone looking for an artistically done adventure.” (CNET)</p>";
