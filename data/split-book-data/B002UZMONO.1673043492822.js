window.bookSummaryJSON = "It takes time to become a leader. While some people appear to be born leaders, the ability to lead is actually a collection of skills, nearly all of which can be learned and improved upon. Based on his <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</i>, Dr. John C. Maxwell presents a daily plan to help you grow as a leader in your personal, professional, and spiritual life. Over the course of 21 weeks, you'll consider characters who positively or negatively modeled the 21 Laws of Leadership - people from the Bible such as Joseph, Joshua, Nehemiah, and Deborah. <p>Leadership is complicated and has many facets - respect, experience, emotional strength, vision, timing, people skills - the list goes on. The good news is that no matter where you are right now, you can reach new, higher levels of effectiveness, and this program can be a vital tool in that process.</p>";
