window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the great tradition of the American almanac, <i>The Areas of My Expertise</i> is a brilliant and hilarious compendium of handy reference tables, fascinating trivia, and sage wisdom on all topics large and small. Although best sellers such as <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i> and <i>The Book of Lists</i> were certainly valuable, they also were largely true. Here is a different kind of handy desk reference, one in which all of the historical oddities and amazing true facts are sifted through the singular, illuminating imagination of John Hodgman, which is the nice way of saying: He made it all up.";
