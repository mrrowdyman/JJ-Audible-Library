window.bookSummaryJSON = "Carol O'Connell's last novel, <i>Dead Famous</i>, made multiple best-of-year lists and won critical acclaim nationwide. \"O'Connell brings a hard edge of greatness to the crime thriller,\" wrote the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>. \"A tough and brilliant action-, wit-, and surprise-packed novel.\" <p> But never has Mallory faced as many surprises as in the case before her now. It seems cut-and-dried at first: a burglar has been caught in the act and killed by an ice pick-wielding homeowner. Except that the homeowner turns out to be the most famous lost child in NYPD history, missing for almost 60 years, thought to have been kidnapped following the massacre of her family: five siblings, father, stepmother, nanny, and housekeeper, nearly the entire household wiped out...with an ice pick.</p> <p> Filled with the intricate plotting and extraordinary characterization that are O'Connell's hallmarks, <i>Winter House</i> is her most powerful, and most astonishing, novel yet.</p>";
