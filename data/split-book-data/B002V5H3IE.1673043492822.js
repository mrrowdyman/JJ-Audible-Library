In \"I Know What You Need,\" a pretty college co-ed finds the perfect lover while on a campus in Maine. A young man thrills to the eerie mists of a murderous \"Strawberry Spring.\" A winter storm hits and a group of old codgers who regularly gather around the Reliable at Henry's Nite-Owl discover the gruesome fate of an old crony in the title story, \"Gray Matter.\" A son, horrified by the grim indignity of death, struggles with his love for \"The Woman in the Room,\" while a hit man, back from a successful assignment, finds himself besieged by a toy army that turns his New York penthouse into a deadly \"Battleground.\"</p>";
