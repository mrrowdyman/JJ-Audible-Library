window.bookSummaryJSON = "Consummate master of his craft, Stephen King has kept millions awake past midnight shivering at tales that probe the shadows and reveal the dark side. Now listeners can chill to this second dramatic unabridged production of short stories from his best selling book, <i>Night Shift</i>. It brings Stephen King's demonic stories fully to life - and the terror even closer to home. <p> Dropout drifter Hall has crossed the country doing whatever comes his way. Working the \"Graveyard Shift\" in a decaying Massachusetts mill under a bullying foreman is just one more leg in his crazy quilt journey, until it leads to a nether realm where the Rat Queen defends her empire. Things are never as they seem, as \"The Man Who Loved Flowers\" proves one perfect Spring evening on the sidewalks of New York. In \"The Last Rung on the Ladder\" beautiful Kitty hangs from dizzying heights above a hideous fate and, in \"Night Surf,\" a group of teenagers on a late summer beach watch the world end in a gruesome, viral whimper. The mind-numbing secrets of \"Jerusalem's Lot\" wait in an ancestral mansion where blood binds the Boone family to a timeless history of unspeakable evil.</p>";
