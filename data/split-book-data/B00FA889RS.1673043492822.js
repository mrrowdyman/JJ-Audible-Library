Wanting to escape an upcoming arranged marriage, she lies to Geoffrey and her family and sails to Virginia on the eve of the American Revolution. If war comes, she may be trapped by events, considered an enemy, and forced to return to England. On the voyage, she loses her heart to the charming, cynical Geoffrey, who has his own reasons to distrust her. Amelia dares not tell him the truth - until it is too late. </p>";
