window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here is a book that applies the lessons of the best-selling parable <i>The Go-Giver</i> to real-world situations.</p> <p><i>The Go-Giver</i> took the business world by storm with its message that giving is the most fulfilling and most effective path to success. It has inspired more than 125,000 readers and listeners—but some have wondered how the story's lessons stand up to the tough challenges of everyday, real-world business. Now Bob Burg and John David Mann answer that question in <i>Go-Givers Sell More</i>, a practical guide that makes giving the cornerstone of a powerful and effective approach to selling. </p> <p>Most of us think of sales as convincing potential customers to believe or do something they don't really want to. But that cutthroat mentality makes the process much harder than it has to be—especially in an economic downturn, when customers are more suspicious and defensive. It's far more productive (and satisfying) when salespeople think like Go-Givers and focus exclusively on creating value for the customer. Cultivate a trusting relationship and provide outstanding service, say the authors, and great results will follow automatically. Illustrating their points with a wide range of real-life examples, Burg and Mann offer tips and strategies that anyone in sales can start applying right away.</p>";
