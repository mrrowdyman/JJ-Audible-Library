window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Discover how Tapping can help you release your negative beliefs about money and open the door to more wealth than you ever imagined. Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), also known as Tapping, has become a popular tool for realizing goals, as evidenced by the recent <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Tapping Solution</i> by Nick Ortner. For many of us, one of our main aspirations is to flourish in our careers and, by extension, in our finances. Yet limiting beliefs and fears keep people stuck in their current financial states. EFT uses the fingertips to tap on acupuncture points while emotionally tuning in to negative attitudes and past experiences, allowing people to transform their thoughts and feelings. Margaret M. Lynch teaches people how to harness the power of Tapping to identify and clear the blocks to prosperity. </p>";
