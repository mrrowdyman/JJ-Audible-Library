window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deputy Mattie Cobb is in a dark place and has withdrawn from Cole Walker and his family to work on issues from her past. When she and her K-9 partner, Robo, get called to track a missing junior high student, they find the girl dead on Smoker's Hill behind the high school, and Mattie must head to the Walker home to break the bad news. But that's only the start of trouble in Timber Creek because soon another girl goes missing - and this time it's one of Cole's daughters. </p> <p>Knowing that each hour a child remains missing lessens the probability of finding her alive, Mattie and Robo lead the hunt while Cole and community volunteers join in to search everywhere, but to no avail. It seems that someone has snatched all trace of the Walker girl from their midst, including her scent. Grasping at straws, Mattie and Robo follow a phoned-in tip into the dense forest, where they hope to find a trace of the girl's scent and to rescue her alive. But when Robo does catch her scent, it leads them to information that challenges everything they thought they knew about the case. </p> <p>Mattie and Robo must rush to hunt down the kidnapper before they're too late in <i>Hunting Hour</i>, the third installment in critically acclaimed author Margaret Mizushima's exhilarating mystery series. </p>";
