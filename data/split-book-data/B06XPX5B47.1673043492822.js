Traumatised travellers have been reporting strange encounters on their morning commute, with strangely dressed people trying to deliver an urgent message. Stranger still, despite calling the police themselves, within a few minutes the commuters have already forgotten the encounter - making the follow-up interviews rather difficult.&nbsp;</p> <p>So with a little help from Abigail and Toby the ghost hunting dog, Peter and Jaget are heading out on a ghost hunting expedition.</p> <p>Because finding the ghosts and deciphering their urgent message might just be a matter of life and death.</p> <p>Read by Kobna Holdbrook-Smith.</p>";
