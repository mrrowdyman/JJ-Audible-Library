window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>William Smithback, a <i>New York Times</i> reporter, and his wife, Nora Kelly, a Museum of Natural History archeologist, are brutally attacked in their apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Eyewitnesses claim and the security camera confirms the killer seen leaving the building was their strange, sinister neighbor - a man who, by all reports, was already dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Captain Hayward leads the official homicide investigation, while Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Nora undertake a private quest for the truth. Their serpentine journey takes them into a part of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive and deadly hotbed of Obeah, the West Indian Zombii cult of sorcery and magic. And it is here they find their true peril is just beginning.</p>";
