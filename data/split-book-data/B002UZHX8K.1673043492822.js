window.bookSummaryJSON = "Keith Ferrazzi is a master networker who claims his secret is merely reaching out to other people. And what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships, so that everyone wins. In <i>Never Eat Alone</i>, Ferrazzi presents the specific steps and mindset he uses to connect with the thousands of individuals in his Rolodex. <p>Ferrazzi's form of connecting to people is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. He distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \"networking\". In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers and more, <i>Never Eat Alone</i> is destined to take its place as an inspirational classic.</p>";
