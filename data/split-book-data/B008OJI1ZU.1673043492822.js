window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Prince of Chaos</i> is the tenth and final installment of The Chronicles of Amber; an epic fantasy series written by six-time Hugo Award winning and three-time Nebula Award winning author, Roger Zelazny. </p> <p>The ten books that make up the series are told in two story arcs: The Corwin Cycle and the Merlin Cycle.</p> <p>Narrator Wil Wheaton, who won the 2012 Audie Award for his engaging performance of <i>Fuzzy Nation</i>, brings this classic series to a stunning close by giving voice to Merlin, Corwin’s son, in the final five books of the series. </p> <p>Treacheries, trickeries, assassination attempts and bloody family intrigues have finally maneuvered Merlin, aka Merle Corey, into the Courts of Chaos. Thanks to a series of conventionally fatal \"accidents\" engineered by his mother Dara and uncle Mandor, Merlin third in line to occupy the throne. </p> <p>Merlin's journey to the ultimate rule will not be easy, for dark enchantments still await him. There is murderous discord between Amber and Chaos to be silenced. And a captive royal father, long believed dead, must first be freed from a villain's magic before a beleaguered Prince can deem his triumph complete.</p>";
