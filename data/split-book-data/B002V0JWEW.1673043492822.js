But now her perfect sister Belinda is tying the knot and Sophy's going to have to produce the charming, successful ideal boyfriend she invented, since the genuine article vanished after a single, resoundingly unsuccessful evening.</p> <p> Desperate, she hires a male escort sight unseen to get her through the Nuptials from Hell. But the trouble with white lies is they tend to multiply, especially at a gala disaster filled with new intrigues and old flames. And the trouble with Josh, her hired date, is he's kind of cute, in a rugged, too sexy for his own good way. And then there's the biggest trouble of all, because every wedding day is followed by a night. And, of course, a morning after.</p>";
