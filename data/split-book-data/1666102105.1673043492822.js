Together with Jaget Kumar, his counterpart at the British Transport Police, he must brave the terrifying crush of London's rush hour to find the source of the ghosts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joined by Peter's wannabe wizard cousin, a preschool river god, and Toby the ghost hunting dog, their investigation takes a darker tone as they realize that a real person's life might just be on the line.&nbsp;</p> <p>And time is running out to save them.</p>";
