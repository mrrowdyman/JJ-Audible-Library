window.bookSummaryJSON = "What would you read if you had the time? What would you learn if you could? Spend just three hours with Steve Leveen's <i>Little Guide to Your Well-Read Life</i> and you could gain a lifetime of greater fulfillment as a reader. The secret, as Steve will tell you, is to know how to fall, and stay, in book love. That's easy to do, once you give yourself permission to read your way.<p> This means knowing how to find the books that speak to your interests, passions, and desires. Being able to give up on a book with no guilt. Discovering the full power of audiobooks. And learning how to become an active reader: the athlete rather than the spectator.</p><p> The CEO and co-founder of Levenger, Steve was inspired to write this <i>Little Guide</i> to help repair what he calls his own ill-read life. What he learns, about reading groups, libraries, and even speed reading, may surprise you.</p><p> But perhaps the most important discovery is this: that a well-read life has little to do with how many or even which books you read. Rather, it has everything to do with a life well-lived.</p>";
