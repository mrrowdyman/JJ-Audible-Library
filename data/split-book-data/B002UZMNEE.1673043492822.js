window.bookSummaryJSON = "Playing upon our most primal fears, Stephen King draws us into his sinister world - a place where sane men and women see their lives shattered, their realities distorted and destroyed. Now, listeners can probe even deeper into the mind of the master storyteller of the macabre, with this third unabridged production of 5 classic short stories, from King's best selling collection, <i>Night Shift</i>. <p> Harold Parkette disposes of his lawnmower after his neighbor's cat dies a gruesome death. But the \"Lawnmower Man\" he hires to do the job proves more than Harold bargained for. A police officer begins to suspect that a series of grisly industrial accidents is no coincidence in \"The Mangler.\" At \"Quitter's Inc.\" a smoker soon discovers that they'll truly stop at nothing to make sure their customers kick the habit. A betrayed husband goes out on \"The Ledge\" when he takes vengeance into his own hands. And in \"Sometimes They Come Back,\" the concept of alumni is given new meaning when a high school teacher, haunted by the past, is assigned 3 new students who seem eerily familiar.</p>";
