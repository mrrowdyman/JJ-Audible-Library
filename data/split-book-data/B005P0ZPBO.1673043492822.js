window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Based upon his weekly <i>Harvard Business Review</i> column (one of the most popular columns on HBR.com, receiving hundreds of thousands of unique page views a month), <i>18 Minutes</i> clearly shows how busy people can cut through all the daily clutter and distractions and find a way to focus on those key items that are truly the top priorities in our lives. </p> <p>Bregman works from the premise that the best way to combat constant and distracting interruptions is to create productive distractions of one's own. Based upon a series of short bite-sized chapters, his approach allows us to safely navigate through the constant chatter of emails, text messages, phone calls, and endless meetings that prevent us from focusing our time on those things that are truly important to us. </p> <p>Mixing first-person insights along with unique case studies, Bregman sprinkles his charming audiobook with pathways that help guide us - pathways that can get us on the right trail in 18 minutes or less.</p>";
