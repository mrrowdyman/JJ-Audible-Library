window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We have real hope we’re called to share.&nbsp;But&nbsp;how&nbsp;we share it makes a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Christians today face a dilemma: In a world that seems to reject everything we believe, how do we walk closely with God without caving to pressure&nbsp;or&nbsp;alienating those we hope to reach?</p> <p>In this eye-opening new book, Chris Hodges provides a solution by examining the life of the prophet Daniel, who persevered in a corrupt culture that closely resembles our own — and emerged as an influential force in God’s redemptive plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of scripture and seasoned with Hodges’ candid personal insights,&nbsp;<i>The Daniel Dilemma</i>&nbsp;shows us that standing for truth isn’t about winning the argument; it’s about winning hearts. And when we learn the secret of connecting before correcting, we discover that we&nbsp;can hold firmly to biblical beliefs without becoming obnoxious, insulting, or mad; stand strong while loving others well; and respond to today’s hard questions without compromising grace or truth.&nbsp;</p> <p>With fresh insights and practical ideas, Hodges encourages Christians struggling with our cultural reality to hold God’s standards high and his grace deep — just as Jesus did, and just as his followers today are called to do.&nbsp;</p>";
