window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the more than 15 years since its publication, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> has become an international phenomenon. Tens of millions of people in business, government, schools, and families have dramatically improved their lives and organizations by applying the principles of Stephen R. Covey's classic book.&nbsp;</p> <p>The world, though, is a vastly changed place. The challenges we all face in our relationships, families, professional lives, and communities are of an entirely new order of magnitude.&nbsp;</p> <p>Being effective as individuals and organizations is no longer merely an option. But in order to thrive, innovate, excel, and lead in what Covey calls the new Knowledge Worker Age, we must build on and move beyond effectiveness. The call of this new era in human history is for <i>greatness</i>; it's for <i>fulfillment</i>, <i>passionate execution</i>, and <i>significant contribution</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Accessing the higher levels of human genius and motivation in today's new reality requires a sea change in thinking. The crucial challenge of our world today is this: <i>to find our voice and inspire others to find theirs</i>. It is what Covey calls the 8th Habit.&nbsp;</p> <p>So many people feel frustrated, discouraged, unappreciated, and undervalued, with little or no sense of voice of unique contribution. <i>The 8th Habit</i> is the answer to the soul's yearning for greatness, the organization's imperative for significance and superior results, and humanity's search for its \"voice\". This groundbreaking audiobook of next level thinking gives a clear way to finally tap the limitless value-creation promise of the Knowledge Worker Age.&nbsp;</p> <p>Covey's new audiobook will transform the way we think about ourselves and our purpose in life, about our organizations, and about humankind. Just as <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> helped us focus on effectiveness, <i>The 8th Habit</i> shows us the way to greatness.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b> On the cover and in the introduction, the audio mentions that a free bonus DVD is included. It is <b>NOT</b> included with this audio; however, you're able to stream the content for free after signing up at the following FranklinCovey website: www.StephenCovey.com.</p>";
