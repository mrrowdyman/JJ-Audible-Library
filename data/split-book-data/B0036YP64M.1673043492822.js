window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After focusing on topics ranging from teamwork and leadership to employee engagement and meetings <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has finally turned his attention toward his own craftâ€”consulting and client service. Tapping into the simple but powerful model that his firm, The Table Group, has been built on, Lencioni presents what may be his most engaging, humorous audiobook yet.</p> <p>Getting Naked tells the remarkable story of a management consultant who is trying desperately to merge two firms with very different approaches to serving clients. One relies on vulnerability and complete transparency; the other focuses on proving its competence and protecting its reputation for intellectual prowess. In the process of managing the merger, the consultant is forced to learn life-changing lessons that prove to be as relevant as they are painful.</p> <p>As he does in his other audiobooks, Lencioni provides readers with concepts that are accessible and compelling. He explains the three fears that provoke service providers to unknowingly sabotage their ability to build trust and loyalty. And, as always, Lencioni provides a practical approach for overcoming those fears.</p>";
