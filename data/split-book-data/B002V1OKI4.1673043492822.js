Another, for skimming bingo profits. And the third, for a career-ending drunken joyride. Meeting daily in the prison law library, taking exercise walks in their boxer shorts, these judges-turned-felons can reminisce about old court cases, dispense a little jailhouse justice, and contemplate where their lives went wrong.</p> <p>Or they can use their time in prison to get very rich - very fast.

Because they've just found the perfect victim....&nbsp;</p>";
