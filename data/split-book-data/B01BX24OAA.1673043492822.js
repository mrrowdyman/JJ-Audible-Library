window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Each of us has but one life to live on this earth. What we do with it is our choice. Are we drifting through it as spectators, reacting to our circumstances when necessary and wondering just how we got to this point anyway? Or are we directing it, maximizing the joy and potential of every day, living with a purpose or mission in mind? </p> <p>Too many of us are doing the former - and our lives are slipping away one day at a time. But what if we treated life like the gift that it is? What if we lived each day as though it was part of a bigger picture, a plan? That's what <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Michael Hyatt and executive coach Daniel Harkavy show us how to do: to design a life with the end in mind, determining in advance the outcomes we desire and the path to get there. In this step-by-step guide, they share proven principles that help listeners create simple but effective life plans so that they can get from where they are now to where they really want to be - in every area of life. </p>";
