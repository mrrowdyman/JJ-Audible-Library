window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The scandal would rip through English society - but how can they resist falling recklessly, irreversibly in love? A series of disasters in Eleanor Lindale’s well-to-do family kept her out of the social whirl where she might have attracted suitors. Now, at age 25, she believes she is irretrievably on the shelf. But her quiet life in Brighton abruptly changes when she’s asked to chaperone her beautiful 17-year-old niece, Lady Aurora Crossways, for a brief season before Aurora’s wedding to Philip Radford, Earl of Huntley. Aurora’s flirtatious and boisterous behavior is difficult for Eleanor to manage. More trying still are Eleanor’s growing feelings for Philip, and his for her. But will Philip’s strong sense of honor prevent him from following his heart?</p>";
