Though the police believe they have the right man, key components of the prosecution case are missing. There is no body of the victim, no witnesses to the crime, no confession and no physical evidence: no DNA, CCTV or murder weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Journalists and TV producers Darrell Brown and Sophie Ellis examine the extraordinary case of Suzanne Pilley, a woman who vanished whilst on her way to work in Edinburgh in 2010. The pair has spent two years investigating the case and speaking exclusively to David Gilroy - the man who was found guilty of killing Suzanne and disposing of her body. He is currently serving a life sentence in a Scottish jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But Gilroy says he is innocent: victim of a miscarriage of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Darrell and Sophie are not so sure. They explore Gilroy’s claims that the investigation and trial were mishandled, that key pieces of evidence were not presented in court and witnesses were not contacted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The pair uncover startling information, not heard in court, that might have changed the minds of the jury. And they shine a light on aspects of the Scottish criminal justice system that might be keeping an innocent man behind bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A What’s the Story Films production for Audible.</p>";
